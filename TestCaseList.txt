From company perspective to be saure There are no loopholes from user perspective, where he could laverage a bug to hes adventage
    - All above + TC #5 - Verify place bet with input set different combinations

Test cases that are most suited to autoamte:
    - all the test cases are suited to automate.
    - The most problematic ones are all TC that will have to wait for the full roll cycle. it will take longer time to execute such TC.
    - Addionally The only way currently for me to check whenever given game won is to:
        - after rolled game check which Placed bet section changed to positive 
        - after rolled game check previous won bet icon and compare it with the placed bet section change.
        - according to that result i can check balance if properly increased or decreased.


Framwork:

    - I have chosen Playwright framwork:
        - as it works directly with TS and JS
        - enables for a quick test mock up using the test ui runner 
        ( very handy for a very quick test to have at least some coverage that can be refactored to POM )
        - fast, a lot of features out of the box
        - does a lot of checks under the hood on actions like click etc. ( waits for visib, clickable etc -  selenium could learn from this )
        - able to run parallel on different browsers and mobile browser vieport
        - For the sake of those tests here i have disabled parallel and multiple browsers


Test cases selected for automation:
    I have chosen few test cases that i believe i am able to automate without any issues.
    Some of the Test cases in my list are more or less harded or require User being logged in to be able to fully Verify
